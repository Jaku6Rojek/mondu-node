# Security Policy

## Demo Application only

This project serves as a demo application and is not intended to be run in an untrusted environment. 
The code is neither security audited nor optimized for security.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability you deem severe enough to report here (think privilege escalation, RCE etc.),
please consider opening a private security advisory. I will get back to you asap.
