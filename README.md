# 🚧 Mondu Integration 🚧
This repo will eventually keep a Mondu.ai demo integration. However, it's the first app I'm writing using NodeJS and express, so expect bugs, 🍝-code and general nastyness. It's a work in progress. Don't try this at home!

## How it works

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hreinberger/mondu-node.git && cd mondu-node
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
# insert your API key in the .env
npm install
npm start
```
You can now access the app at `localhost:3000`.
